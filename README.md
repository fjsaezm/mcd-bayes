Bayesian Methods in Machine Learning
---

Two assigments have been done:

- The first one is about the **Expectation-Maximization** algorithm, used to learn **Gaussian Mixtures** (Folder [P1](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-bayes/tree/main/P1))
- The second one is about **Variational Autoencoders**. We code an autoencoder and apply it to the **MNIST** dataset, doing some experiments with the generation of different numbers (Folder [P2](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-bayes/tree/main/P2))
